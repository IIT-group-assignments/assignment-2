      <div class="row">
        <h3 class="it-technologies__heading" id="infrastructure">Clouds,
          Services, Servers</h3>
        <div class="technologies__columns">
          <p class="technologies__paragraphs">Cloud computing is a relatively
            new
            technology which has dramatically influenced the adoption of
            technology in businesses. There are 3 main types of cloud services.
            Public, Private and Hybrid.</p>
          <p class="technologies__paragraphs">Public clouds are those which are
            available to anyone. A business buys an instance or instances of
            virtual computing space or storage space, which are hosted on
            computers somewhere in the world. You are unlikely to ever know
            where
            the computers are, who has access to the data, or even what sort of
            hardware is behind the service. The main players in this market are
            Microsoft with their Azure platform, Amazon with the AWS platform,
            and
            Google also now have a similar offering Google Cloud.</p>
          <p class="technologies__paragraphs">In the simplest terms, a Cloud
            platform is a computer which you can use, but you don’t own, and is
            not located at your own premises.</p>
          <p class="technologies__paragraphs">A private cloud is a little
            different. While the services you are accessing are still not
            located at your business premises, but likely located in a
            specialised data centre, they belong to you. You are responsible for
            the cost of hardware, software and maintenance and upgrades. You
            likely pay a fee for an amount of rack space you are using and have
            an allowance for data and power usage. Included in the fee is the
            facility, security, air conditioning and other environmental factors
            such as fire detection and suppression.</p>
          <p class="technologies__paragraphs">A Hybrid solution can be either a
            combination of public and private, or on-premises and public or
            private. An example might be, having your servers and data onsite,
            but using a public cloud as a backup repository, and using a public
            cloud for a development environment. Or you may use an on-premises
            solution for your core infrastructure, while replicating data to a
            private datacentre environment for use as a disaster recovery
            environment.</p>
          <p class="technologies__paragraphs">Utilizing public cloud storage is
            very popular for backup storage. Both Azure Blobs and AWS S3 or
            Glacier are popular choices, as putting data in is free – you only
            pay for the space you consume, and storage is reliable with a high
            availability. Public cloud storage is an ideal option for businesses
            who seek long term reliable storage that is cost efficient.</p>
          <p class="technologies__paragraphs">One of the main benefits to a
            business of using a cloud environment is simply the scalability. If
            you need a new or additional server, you can run a new virtual
            server up in PowerShell using Microsoft Azure in a few minutes. No
            hardware expenditure involved. You only pay for the time that your
            server is on and running. So, it is extremely flexible for
            application and database development which may need a lot of
            resources but might only be used for a few hours per day. This way,
            you only need to pay for the time that the server is running. Shut
            it down when finished, and the charging stops.</p>
          <p class="technologies__paragraphs">The availability and easy
            accessibility of cloud services has also led to an abundance of new
            services. Some of the very first of these were Microsoft’s Fleet of
            Office365 products. Where, you no longer need to buy a server,
            software and licensing to have your own Microsoft Exchange server.
            Now a business can gain all the functionality of Microsoft Exchange,
            for a small monthly cost per user. This is also flexible. Instead of
            needing to buy your Exchange licenses in bundles of 10, 25, 50 or
            100. You can add as many as you like, or as few as you like at a
            time. You can also flexibly use add and remove licenses at a time.
            You can bundle the mail license with an office license, giving each
            user account the latest full Microsoft Office suite products, as
            well as OneDrive storage, MS Teams, and other collaboration
            products. These initial services have led to other services, such as
            SaaS, where you can pay a software vendor for a cloud instance of
            their software. No need to run a physical or virtual server
            on-premises, or even a cloud server, you simply pay to use the
            software as you go. The software vendor is responsible for the
            entire hardware and software platform. You just use the software.
          </p>
          <p class="technologies__paragraphs">One of the newest iterations of
            the cloud computing environment, is DaaS. Desktop as a Service,
            where you can gain access to a virtual desktop computer, with all
            your organization’s software installed. This is ideal for people
            working from home and is popular in large educational institutions
            where a thin client is used to access a virtual desktop for
            students. The desktop computer follows the student around to their
            classes or any other device they access it from.</p>
          <p class="technologies__paragraphs">These services also have a large
            benefit for the vendor of the product. Their costs for updates are
            greatly reduced. They no longer have to produce CD/DVD media to
            distribute updates, or new license keys for new versions. They can
            simply update a central server, and all users of the software will
            then be using the latest version of the software. Managing licenses
            and income is much easier for the vendor also. Licenses are often
            linked to your business e-mail addresses, making software piracy and
            sharing of license keys almost impossible.</p>
          <p class="technologies__paragraphs">This is not having a detrimental
            impact on jobs in the industry, but rather an increase in jobs. The
            types of jobs maybe slightly different, but it is still a growth
            industry. There has been a huge growth in datacentre installations
            Australia wide, and globally. These environments still need support.
            However, the support roles have often shifted from the business
            premises, to the datacentre itself.</p>
          <p class="technologies__paragraphs">The main impact this has had on IT
            professionals, is a need to upskill. To understand how to utilize
            and manage cloud platforms, how to offer customers an option to take
            up and utilize the benefits offered by cloud computing. There is new
            terminology, new skills, and especially new attack surfaces to
            consider</p>
          <p class="technologies__paragraphs">One of the main benefits to end
            users has been seen over the interesting times with Covid 19
            restrictions. So many industries have been able to continue to
            function successfully, with almost their entire workforces
            functioning in geographically different locations, yet maintaining
            connectivity through cloud platforms like Teams, Skype for Business,
            Webex, still working utilizing the same resources through
            SharePoint, and doing all this securely via full tunnel VPNs.</p>
